function alpha=flag_implicit_significance(i)
% The use of FLAG_IMPLICIT_SIGNIFICANCE is in experimental state. 
% flag_implicit_significance might even become obsolete.
%
% FLAG_IMPLICIT_SIGNIFICANCE sets and gets default alpha (level) of any significance test
% The default alpha-level is stored in the global variable FLAG_implicit_significance
% The idea is that the significance must not be assigned explicitely. 
% This might yield more readable code. 
%
% Choose alpha low enough, because in alpha*100% of the cases, you will 
% reject the Null hypothesis just by change. For this reason, the default
% alpha is 0.01. 
% 
%   flag_implicit_significance(0.01) 
%	sets the alpha-level for the significance test
% 
% alpha = flag_implicit_significance()
% 	gets default alpha
%
% flag_implicit_significance(alpha)
% 	sets default alpha-level
%
% alpha = flag_implicit_significance(alpha)
%	gets and sets alpha 
%
% features:
% - compatible to Matlab and Octave
