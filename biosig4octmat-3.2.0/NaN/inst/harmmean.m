function [y] = harmmean(x,DIM,W)
% HARMMEAN calculates the harmonic mean of data elements. 
% The harmonic mean is the inverse of the mean of the inverse elements.
% 
% 	y = harmmean(x [,DIM [,W]]) is the same as 
% 	y = mean(x,'H' [,DIM [,W]]) 
%
% DIM	dimension
%	1 STD of columns
%	2 STD of rows
%	default or []: first DIMENSION, with more than 1 element
% W	weights to compute weighted mean (default: [])
%	if W=[], all weights are 1. 
%	number of elements in W must match size(x,DIM) 
%
% features:
% - can deal with NaN's (missing values)
% - weighting of data 
% - dimension argument also in Octave
% - compatible to Matlab and Octave
%
