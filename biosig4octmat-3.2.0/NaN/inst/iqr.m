function Q=iqr(Y,DIM)
% IQR calculates the interquartile range  
%  Missing values (encoded as NaN) are ignored. 
%
%  Q = iqr(Y)
%  Q = iqr(Y,DIM)
%     returns the IQR along dimension DIM of sample array Y.
%
%  Q = iqr(HIS)
%     returns the IQR from the histogram HIS. 
%     HIS must be a HISTOGRAM struct as defined in HISTO2 or HISTO3.
%
% see also: MAD, RANGE, HISTO2, HISTO3, PERCENTILE, QUANTILE
