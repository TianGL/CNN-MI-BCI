function o=meansq(x,DIM,W)
% MEANSQ calculates the mean of the squares
%
% y = meansq(x,DIM,W)
%
% DIM	dimension
%	1 STD of columns
%	2 STD of rows
% 	N STD of  N-th dimension 
%	default or []: first DIMENSION, with more than 1 element
% W	weights to compute weighted mean (default: [])
%	if W=[], all weights are 1. 
%	number of elements in W must match size(x,DIM) 
%
% features:
% - can deal with NaN's (missing values)
% - weighting of data  
% - dimension argument also in Octave
% - compatible to Matlab and Octave
%
% see also: SUMSQ, SUMSKIPNAN, MEAN, VAR, STD, RMS
