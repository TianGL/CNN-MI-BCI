function [D, M] = medAbsDev(X, DIM)
% medAbsDev calculates the median absolute deviation 
%
% Usage:  D = medAbsDev(X, DIM)  
%    or:  [D, M] = medAbsDev(X, DIM)
% Input:  X  : data
%         DIM: dimension along which mad should be calculated (1=columns, 2=rows) 
%               (optional, default=first dimension with more than 1 element
% Output: D  : median absolute deviations
%         M  : medians (optional)
