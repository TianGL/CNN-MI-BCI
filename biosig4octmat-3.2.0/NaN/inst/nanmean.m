function [o] = nanmean(i,DIM)
% NANMEAN same as SUM but ignores NaN's. 
% NANMEAN is OBSOLETE; use MEAN instead. NANMEAN is included 
%    to provide backward compatibility 
%
% Y = nanmean(x [,DIM])
% 
% DIM	dimension
%	1 sum of columns
%	2 sum of rows
%	default or []: first DIMENSION with more than 1 element
% Y	resulting mean
