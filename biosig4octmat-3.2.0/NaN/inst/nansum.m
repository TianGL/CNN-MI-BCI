% NANSUM same as SUM but ignores NaN's. 
% NANSUM is OBSOLETE; use SUMSKIPNAN instead. NANSUM is included 
%    to fix a bug in some other versions.

% Y = nansum(x [,DIM])
% 
% DIM	dimension
%	1 sum of columns
%	2 sum of rows
%	default or []: first DIMENSION with more than 1 element
% Y	resulting sum
