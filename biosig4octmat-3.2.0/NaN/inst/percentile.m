function Q=percentile(Y,q,DIM)
% PERCENTILE calculates the percentiles of histograms and sample arrays.  
%
%  Q = percentile(Y,q)      
%  Q = percentile(Y,q,DIM)      
%     returns the q-th percentile along dimension DIM of sample array Y.
%     size(Q) is equal size(Y) except for dimension DIM which is size(Q,DIM)=length(Q)
%
%  Q = percentile(HIS,q)
%     returns the q-th percentile from the histogram HIS. 
%     HIS must be a HISTOGRAM struct as defined in HISTO2 or HISTO3.
%     If q is a vector, the each row of Q returns the q(i)-th percentile
