function r = ranks(X,DIM,Mode)
% RANKS gives the rank of each element in a vector.
% This program uses an advanced algorithm with averge effort O(m.n.log(n)) 
% NaN in the input yields NaN in the output.
% 
% r = ranks(X[,DIM])
%   if X is a vector, return the vector of ranks of X adjusted for ties.
%   if X is matrix, the rank is calculated along dimension DIM. 
%   if DIM is zero or empty, the lowest dimension with more then 1 element is used. 
% r = ranks(X,DIM,'traditional')
%   implements the traditional algorithm with O(n^2) computational 
%   and O(n^2) memory effort
% r = ranks(X,DIM,'mtraditional')
%   implements the traditional algorithm with O(n^2) computational 
%   and O(n) memory effort
% r = ranks(X,DIM,'advanced   ')
%   implements an advanced algorithm with O(n*log(n)) computational 
%   and O(n.log(n)) memory effort
% r = ranks(X,DIM,'advanced-ties')
%   implements an advanced algorithm with O(n*log(n)) computational 
%   and O(n.log(n)) memory effort
%   but without correction for ties 
%   This is the fastest algorithm

% Features:
% + is fast, uses an efficient algorithm for the rank correlation
% + computational effort is O(n.log(n)) instead of O(n^2)
% + memory effort is O(n.log(n)), instead of O(n^2). 
%     Now, the ranks of 8000 elements can be easily calculated
% + NaNs in the input yield NaN in the output 
% + compatible with Octave and Matlab
% + traditional method is also implemented for comparison.
