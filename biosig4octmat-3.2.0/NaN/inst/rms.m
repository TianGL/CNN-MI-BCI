function o=rms(x,DIM,W)
% RMS calculates the root mean square
%   can deal with complex data. 
%
% y = rms(x,DIM,W)
%
% DIM	dimension
%	1 STD of columns
%	2 STD of rows
% 	N STD of  N-th dimension 
%	default or []: first DIMENSION, with more than 1 element
% W	weights to compute weighted s.d. (default: [])
%	if W=[], all weights are 1. 
%	number of elements in W must match size(x,DIM) 
%
% y	estimated standard deviation
%
% features:
% - can deal with NaN's (missing values)
% - weighting of data 
% - dimension argument also in Octave
% - compatible to Matlab and Octave
%
