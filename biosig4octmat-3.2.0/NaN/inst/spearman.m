function r = spearman(x,y)
% SPEARMAN Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
% This function is replaced by CORRCOEF. 
% Significance test and confidence intervals can be obtained from CORRCOEF. 
%
% [R,p,ci1,ci2] = CORRCOEF(x, [y, ] 'Rank');
%
% For some (unknown) reason, in previous versions Spearman's rank correlation  
%   r = corrcoef(ranks(x)). 
% But according to [1], Spearman's correlation is defined as 
%   r = 1-6*sum((ranks(x)-ranks(y)).^2)/(N*(N*N-1))
% The results are different. Here, the later version is implemented.
