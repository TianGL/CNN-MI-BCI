function Z = zScoreMedian(X, DIM)
% zScoreMedian removes the median and standardizes by the 1.483*median absolute deviation
%
% Usage:  Z = zScoreMedian(X, DIM)
% Input:  X  : data
%         DIM: dimension along which z-score should be calculated (1=columns, 2=rows) 
%              (optional, default=first dimension with more than 1 element
% Output: Z  : z-scores
