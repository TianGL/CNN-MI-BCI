%% Transform a s-plane filter specification into a z-plane
%% specification. Filters can be specified in either zero-pole-gain or
%% transfer function form. The input form does not have to match the
%% output form. T is the sampling frequency represented in the z plane.
%%
%% Theory: Given a piecewise flat filter design, you can transform it
%% from the s-plane to the z-plane while maintaining the band edges by
%% means of the bilinear transform.  This maps the left hand side of the
%% s-plane into the interior of the unit circle.  The mapping is highly
%% non-linear, so you must design your filter with band edges in the
%% s-plane positioned at 2/T tan(w*T/2) so that they will be positioned
%% at w after the bilinear transform is complete.
%%
%% The following table summarizes the transformation:
%%
%% Transform         Zero at x                  Pole at x
%% ----------------  -------------------------  ------------------------
%% Bilinear          zero: (2+xT)/(2-xT)        pole: (2+xT)/(2-xT)
%%      2 z-1        pole: -1                   zero: -1
%% S -> - ---        gain: (2-xT)/T             gain: (2-xT)/T
%%      T z+1
%% ----------------  -------------------------  ------------------------
%%
%% With tedious algebra, you can derive the above formulae yourself by
%% substituting the transform for S into H(S)=S-x for a zero at x or
%% H(S)=1/(S-x) for a pole at x, and converting the result into the
%% form:
%%
%%    H(Z)=g prod(Z-Xi)/prod(Z-Xj)
%%
%% Please note that a pole and a zero at the same place exactly cancel.
%% This is significant since the bilinear transform creates numerous
%% extra poles and zeros, most of which cancel. Those which do not
%% cancel have a "fill-in" effect, extending the shorter of the sets to
%% have the same number of as the longer of the sets of poles and zeros
%% (or at least split the difference in the case of the band pass
%% filter). There may be other opportunistic cancellations but I will
%% not check for them.
%%
%% Also note that any pole on the unit circle or beyond will result in
%% an unstable filter.  Because of cancellation, this will only happen
%% if the number of poles is smaller than the number of zeros.  The
%% analytic design methods all yield more poles than zeros, so this will
%% not be a problem.
