function [d,ix] = maxdistance(s,Q1,Q2)
% MAXDISTANCE finds the point with the largest distances from a line 
%   connecting the two endpoints in 2-D space. 
%
%  The function is used to find the onset of the a burst in function
%  BURSTANALYSIS, but can be used for other examples too.
%
% usage: 
%	[d,ix] = maxdistance(...)
%	...    = maxdistance(s)
%	...    = maxdistance(s, Q1)
%	...    = maxdistance(s, Q1, Q2)
%
%	d  normal distance of each point in s
%	ix index of point with largest distance
%
